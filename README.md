# Skyrim Modding Website

This is a basic HTML website I created for my web development course. The purpose of this site is to demonstrate proper HTML structure using semantic elements like header, nav, main, section, aside, and footer.

The topic of the website is one of my hobbies: modding The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim using the Creation Kit.

## Features

- Home page with introduction to Skyrim modding
- Navigation menu structure
- Links to modding tools and resources
- Example mod page link (Various Dragons)
- Image example from one of my mods
- Proper semantic HTML structure

## Technologies Used

- HTML5

This project does not use CSS or JavaScript yet, as the focus of the assignment is on HTML structure and semantics.

## Purpose

The goal of this assignment is to practice:

- Structuring a webpage using semantic HTML elements
- Organizing content properly
- Creating a basic website layout
- Understanding how real websites are structured
